# NT8 Indicator for the Pivot Setup

This indicaotr identifies Pivot Setups.  It is not enough to observe a pivot - this must be combined with an understanding of key levels and market trends to make a sucessful trade.

I did not create this concept - it was taught to me in the [Algo Day Trader](https://www.algodaytrader.net) trading room.  He did not create it either.

## What is a Pivot Setup?

A Pivot Setup identifies points where a market trend might reverse direction. This setup is used to detect potential reversals from a downward trend to an upward movement or vice versa.

### Criteria for a Long Trade Setup:
  1. **Establish a Downward Trend**: Successive candles show lower lows.
  2. **Reversal Indication**: The current candle fails to make a new low.
  3. **Breakout Confirmation**: The current candle rises above the high of the previous candle.

### Trade Execution:
  * **Entry Point**: Place an entry order at the high of the previous candle.
  * **Stop Loss**: Set a stop loss at the low of the previous candle.

### Example:
In the following image, there are five candles forming lower lows. As the sixth candle opens, the indicator displays a green triangle at the entry price (the high of the fifth candle) and a red triangle at the stop loss price (the low of the fifth candle). As the sixth candle develops, it moves upward, confirming the reversal.

# Configuration Options

  * **Larger Wick than Body**: The total wick length of the previous candle must be larger than the body of the candle.
  * **Directional Wick**: For a long setup, the preivous candle down wick must be longer than the up wick.  For short, vice versa.
  * **Look Back**: The number of candles to look back at when identifying an up or down trend.
  * **Play Alert Sound**: If the wav files included in the release are saved to C -> Program Files -> Ninja Trader 8 -> sounds, then an alert will play.  A woman's voice will say "NQ Pivot" or "ES Pivot" depending on which market is triggering the alert.
